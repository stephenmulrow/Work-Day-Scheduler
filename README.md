This is a functioning scheduler for a busy adult that could use a hand. You'll find each section of the day broken out by hour, with each color of the section being either gray for time that has passed, red for the current hour you are using the scheduler, and green for hours later in the day. 

When you type something in next to an hour, you can hit the blue SAVE button, which will allow you to keep that information there, even if you refresh the page! Also, the current day that you are using the scheduler is conveniently located at the top. 

This was fun to build as we incorporated using moment.js, along with localStorage to save whatever the user wrote in the text area. I hope you enjoy using this scheduler next time you have a busy day ahead!
